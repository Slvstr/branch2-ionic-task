# branch2-ionic-task
##Branch2 Ionic Test

This task is based on a simplified version of a typical project at Branch2. You will need to develop an app using Ionic Framework that meets the following requirements:

- [ ] Users have accounts and can log in
- [ ] Users set goals for themselves with two parts - the name of the activity, and how many times per day they would like to complete this. (See mockup in goal-tracking.png)
- [ ] Users can track how many times they have completed that activity that day. (See mockup in goal-tracking.png).
- [ ]Use of a backend API such as FireBase is required. FireBase is recommended but not required, and if you choose to use another backend technology please communicate that in the README.md file for the project. Include any other needed info in the README as well.

This is purposely an open-ended task, and you should feel free to implement it however you choose. The mockups are only to communicate functionality and are not how the final product needs to look, feel free to change the UI as you wish.

Please build this app and commit your code when finished.

##Bonus points:

Pick and choose any additional bonus tasks you would like to add, these are in no particular order.

 - [ ] Add any additional styles you wish, in order to improve the UI
 - [ ] Implement other ways of defining and tracking goals. Be creative.
 - [ ] Implement a graph of the user's progress over time. Feel free to load your backend with historical data. Use of D3.js is recommended but not required.
 - [ ] If a user has multiple goals, try to find correlations between their performance on one goal and their performance on another to create an insight such as "When you drink 5 glasses of water per day you are less likely to eat cake." Display these insights in the app somewhere.
